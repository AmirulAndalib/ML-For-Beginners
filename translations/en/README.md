# Machine Learning for Beginners - A Curriculum  

> 🌍 Embark on a global journey as we explore Machine Learning through the lens of world cultures 🌍  

Microsoft's Cloud Advocates are excited to present a 12-week, 26-lesson curriculum focused on **Machine Learning**. This curriculum introduces you to **classic machine learning** techniques, primarily using the Scikit-learn library, while steering clear of deep learning (covered in our [AI for Beginners' curriculum](https://aka.ms/ai4beginners)). Pair these lessons with our ['Data Science for Beginners' curriculum](https://aka.ms/ds4beginners) for a comprehensive learning experience!  

Travel with us across the globe as we apply these techniques to datasets from various regions. Each lesson includes quizzes, step-by-step instructions, solutions, assignments, and more. Our project-based approach ensures you learn by doing, a proven method for retaining new skills.  

**✍️ A big thank you to our authors** Jen Looper, Stephen Howell, Francesca Lazzeri, Tomomi Imura, Cassie Breviu, Dmitry Soshnikov, Chris Noring, Anirban Mukherjee, Ornella Altunyan, Ruth Yakubu, and Amy Boyd  

**🎨 Special thanks to our illustrators** Tomomi Imura, Dasani Madipalli, and Jen Looper  

**🙏 Heartfelt gratitude 🙏 to our Microsoft Student Ambassador authors, reviewers, and contributors**, including Rishit Dagli, Muhammad Sakib Khan Inan, Rohan Raj, Alexandru Petrescu, Abhishek Jaiswal, Nawrin Tabassum, Ioan Samuila, and Snigdha Agarwal  

**🤩 Extra appreciation to Microsoft Student Ambassadors Eric Wanjau, Jasleen Sondhi, and Vidushi Gupta for contributing to our R lessons!**  

# Getting Started  

Follow these steps:  
1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of this page.  
2. **Clone the Repository**:   `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners.git`  

> [Find additional resources for this course in our Microsoft Learn collection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/collections/qrqzamz1nn2wx3?WT.mc_id=academic-77952-bethanycheum)  

**[Students](https://aka.ms/student-page)**, to use this curriculum, fork the repository to your GitHub account and complete the exercises individually or in groups:  

- Begin with a pre-lecture quiz.  
- Read the lecture and complete the activities, pausing for reflection at each knowledge check.  
- Build the projects by understanding the lessons rather than relying on solution code (available in the `/solution` folders for project-based lessons).  
- Take the post-lecture quiz.  
- Complete the challenge.  
- Finish the assignment.  
- After completing a lesson group, visit the [Discussion Board](https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners/discussions) and share your learning using the PAT rubric. A 'PAT' (Progress Assessment Tool) helps you assess your progress and encourages collaborative learning.  

> For further study, explore these [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/users/jenlooper-2911/collections/k7o7tg1gp306q4?WT.mc_id=academic-77952-leestott) modules and learning paths.  

**Teachers**, we have [included some suggestions](for-teachers.md) on how to use this curriculum.

## Pedagogy  

This curriculum is built on two key principles: hands-on **project-based learning** and **frequent quizzes**. Additionally, it follows a common **theme** for cohesion.  

By aligning content with projects, the learning process becomes more engaging, and concepts are easier to retain. Low-stakes quizzes before and after lessons help reinforce learning. The curriculum is flexible and fun, allowing students to take it in full or in part. Projects start simple and grow in complexity over the 12-week cycle. A postscript on real-world ML applications is included for extra credit or discussion.  

> Check out our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md), and [Translation](TRANSLATIONS.md) guidelines. We welcome your feedback!  

## Each lesson includes  

- optional sketchnote  
- optional supplemental video  
- video walkthrough (some lessons only)  
- [pre-lecture warmup quiz](https://ff-quizzes.netlify.app/en/ml/)  
- written lesson  
- for project-based lessons, step-by-step guides on how to build the project  
- knowledge checks  
- a challenge  
- supplemental reading  
- assignment  
- [post-lecture quiz](https://ff-quizzes.netlify.app/en/ml/)  

> **A note about languages**: Lessons are primarily written in Python, but many are also available in R. To complete an R lesson, go to the `/solution` folder and look for files with the .rmd extension. These are **R Markdown** files, which combine code, output, and commentary in a single document. R Markdown documents can be rendered into formats like PDF, HTML, or Word, making them ideal for data science.  

> **A note about quizzes**: All quizzes are located in the [Quiz App folder](../../quiz-app), with 52 quizzes containing three questions each. They are linked within the lessons but can also be run locally. Follow the instructions in the `quiz-app` folder to host them locally or deploy to Azure.
